# Veeam RESTful API & Amazon Alexa

### Disclaimer
* This project is a private one and not supported by Veeam
* I don't have any programming skills. Everthing was put together using copy & paste and trial and error.
* This is just a demo, but it can easily be extended with more features.

### Purpose
I like Alexa and since I am working at Veeam I thought why not use our RESTful API to use with Alexa :)
### Demo
[Demo on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com)
### Overview
![2017-11-29 23_42_25-powerpoint-bildschirmprasentation - grafiken pptx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34011056/33403030-05720f88-d55f-11e7-9f3b-d4d0163d0f69.png)

### Local Setup

 1. [Download](https://ngrok.com/download) **ngrok**
 2. Launch **ngrok** on a machine that has access to **Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager Port 9398**
    ```
    ngrok http 5000
    ```
This will expose localhost:5000 to the public internet.
3. [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install latest version of **Python 3.x** 
4. Use pip to install required python modules:
   ```
   pip install requests flask flask_ask unidecode
   ```
5. Download **veeam-alexa-demo.py** and **veeam-alexa.config** to the machine that runs ngrok
6. Edit veeam-alexa.config with your Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager details:
   ```
   server = "enterprisemanager.dns"
   port = 9398
   verifyssl = False
   admin = "hostname\\Administrator"
   password = "verysecurepassword"
   ```
 7. Start the Python flask app
    ```
    python veeam-alexa.py
    ```
